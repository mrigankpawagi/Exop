_Quest for a Habitable Exoplanet._

> _Exoplanets are planets beyond our own solar system. Thousands have been discovered in the past two decades, mostly with NASA's Kepler Space Telescope._

> _These worlds come in a huge variety of sizes and orbits. Some are gigantic planets hugging close to their parent stars; others are icy, some rocky. NASA and other agencies are looking for a special kind of planet: one that's the same size as Earth, orbiting a sun-like star in the habitable zone._

**EXOP** is a simple Web App, that analyzes a large dataset of about 3300+ exoplanets, and applies on it an intelligent algorithm to check which exoplanet is the 'most identical' to Earth, the home planet, and Mars, the red neighbour which is most likely to have once supported life. 

This is basically meant to give us an idea of which exoplanet out of the dataset is most likely to be habitable.
